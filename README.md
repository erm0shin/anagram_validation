# Validate anagram utility

By using this utility you can validate your anagrams.

You can initialize some additional properties in `appication.properties` file before program start:
- `ignoreCase` - should the program ignore case by string comparison or not
- `symbolsToIgnore` - you can list all the symbols that shouldn't be taken into account by string comparison
